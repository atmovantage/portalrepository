It seems as if an impending update is just over the horizon as Sean Murray has recently started tweeting cryptically about eggs. This coincides with a new curiosity available to purchase at the Quicksilver Synthesis Companion called the <a href="https://nomanssky.gamepedia.com/Void_Egg">Void Egg</a>.
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">An anomalous egg. The shell is tough and leathery, and twitches when touched. A faint tapping can be heard within. From time to time, it appears to sing.</p>
</blockquote>
For those who would like to learn more about this mysterious item and the associated mission, USG has written up a nice guide, <a href="https://www.usgamer.net/articles/no-mans-sky-how-to-get-the-void-egg-and-complete-the-melody-of-the-egg-quest">read it here</a>.
