So who's the "Man Behind the Curtain" of this website? My name's Austin (gamer tag "HusbandVader") and I'm an avid fan of No Man's Sky. I'm also a full-time meteorologist and I operate a <a href="https://atmosphericadvantage.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small web design business</a>.

I started designing websites for fun in 2011 when I was in college and eventually launched my own web design company in 2013.

I initially built The Portal Repository as a hobby in order to log my own intergalactic travels. But it wasn't long before other No Man's Sky fans found the site and wanted to submit their own addresses to the catalog. Since then I've tried to build this site as a community resource, a kind of "phone book" for No Man's Sky.
