Starting at 1600GMT on July 23rd <a title="The Portal
Repository" href="https://portalrepository.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Portal Repository</a> will enter a maintenance mode so that all current <em>Atlas Rises</em> addresses can be locked and archived on a sub-domain. This also will allow time to make changes and updates to the site in preparation of the July 24th release of the NEXT update.

Addresses published on the main domain will be marked clearly to indicate that they are based on the <em>Atlas Rises </em>version. This marking/tag will be removed if updated post-NEXT information is provided.

The duration of downtime is not certain and will depend on the extent of changes involved in the NEXT update. I have taken time off from work so I can dedicate my time to learning new game mechanics of NEXT and so that I can quickly make updates and changes to The Portal Repository.

Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/HusbandVader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> to stay up-to-date on the latest announcements concerning this website. If anyone has specific feedback or feature requests that you'd like to see after the NEXT launch please leave a comment below or send me a DM on <a href="https://twitter.com/HusbandVader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>.

I'm really excited to see what's in store for <em>No Man's Sky</em> in less than 10 days!
