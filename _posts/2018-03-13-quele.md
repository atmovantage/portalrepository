Do you enjoy exploring for exploring’s sake? Quele might be right for you. The landscape is awash in vibrant, violet tones and is suitable for travel by Colossus although there isn’t that much to mine. The real fun here is the abundance of (?) points of interest, usually within 2 minutes walking distance to the next destination. If you enjoy exploring, there’s plenty to visit. A shelter is marked with a comm ball only 14 minute’s walk from the portal.
