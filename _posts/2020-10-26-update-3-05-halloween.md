A small update has been dropped by Hello Games just in time for Halloween! The title of the update is aptly named the "Halloween Update".

The focus of the update is to expand the gameplay associated with the derelict freighters that were introduced in the Desolation update earlier this year.

You can read the full patch notes and release information <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2020/10/halloween-update/">here</a>.

The Portal Repository has been updated to reflect this latest update. New addresses will now include the "Version: Halloween" tag and will be included in the Favorites page since no major procedural changes have occurred.

Reminder: If you find an interesting derelict freighter don't forget to share the portal address to any planet in that system and include the tag "Derelict Freighter" so other players can check it out too! Each star system has a unique type of derelict freighter so players can share coordinates to interesting, and spooky, wrecks.

Happy Halloween Travellers!
