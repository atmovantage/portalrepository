This exotic S-class starship's origin is the star system Oetsusa, which has only a single planetary body called Bukarab Ebotova. The system is located 693,684 light years from the core of the Hilbert Dimension galaxy. This planet is littered with both trading posts and unclaimed habitable bases. The heat (and cold, at night) on this planet can be a real challenge, and there is a Sentinel population classified as "Hostile." If the weather doesn't wear you down, the Sentinels will. You have been warned. This exotic S-class squid starship seems to appear routinely at trading posts, though it took me over 3 hours to score a perfect 20/6 version.
