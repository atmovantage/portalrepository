Today Sean Murray announced that PC <em>No Man's Sky</em> players that have opted into the Experimental branch can now download a new performance-enhancing update called "<strong>Vulkan</strong>". Vulkan is a graphics API that is intended to replace OpenGL in order to optimize resource allocation, increase framerates and improve overall game performance.

You can read the full announcement <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2019/04/vulkan-update/">here</a>.

The Vulkan update will first be rolled out to PC users on the Experimental branch and will be released to other platforms in due time. This technical overhaul will be instrumental in deploying <em>Beyond</em> later this summer with VR support.
