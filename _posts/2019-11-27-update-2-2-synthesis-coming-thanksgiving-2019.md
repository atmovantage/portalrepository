Today, in a series of tweets, Sean Murray announced that the next big update for <em>No Man's Sky</em> would be version 2.2 and is called <em><strong>Synthesis</strong></em>. This patch is set to go live on all platforms November 28th, Thanksgiving Day.

This update focuses on fixing a lot of smaller issues that have been hotly-requested by the community. Here are some portal-related improvements that will be coming with the <em>Synthesis</em> update:
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">1. The cost to activate Portal Glyphs has been reduced.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">2. Fixed an issue where mission steps that involve going through a portal would fail to display any text.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">3. Fixed an issue that prevented players from finding story-critical portals if they left the portal while it was in its active state.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">4. Allowed players to permanently accumulate teleport destinations outside of their home (ie furthest progress) galaxy. Teleport destinations are no longer removed when leaving other galaxies.</p>
I'm glad to see that the cost to activate Portal Glyphs has been reduced as the high price was a barrier-to-entry for some new players. Number 4 is also very exciting because now you don't <em>have to</em> build a base in an old galaxy in order to return to it later. This means that if you find a unique system in Euclid for example that sells a particular commodity, after you progress to the next galaxy you can still teleport back to that space station in Euclid to buy/sell.

With regards to The Portal Repository, since there won't be any substantial changes to procedural generation in the update I will not be archiving all the <em>Beyond</em> addresses. However, addresses submitted on/after November 28th will be given a new version tag for "<em>Synthesis"</em>.

This Thanksgiving, <em>No Man's Sky</em> players have a lot to be thankful for! Thank you Sean Murray!
