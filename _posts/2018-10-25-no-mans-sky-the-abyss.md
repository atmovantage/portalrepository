Hello Games has recently announced the next named update coming out the week of October 29th. The title of the update is "The Abyss" and according to Sean Murray:
<blockquote>It focuses on some of the eerier elements of No Manâ€™s Sky, in keeping with the theme of this season.</blockquote>

Not much else is known about what may be included in this update, however Xaine has put together a helpful video explaining some of the possible upcoming features based on information data-mined from the game files:

There have been several universal resets throughout the history of No Man's Sky, the most recent one happened with the NEXT update. It is unclear whether another universal reset is coming with The Abyss, although personally I would be surprised if procedural generation seeds got reset again so soon after NEXT.

In any event, if the universe does get reset with The Abyss I will migrate all the NEXT addresses from the Main Repository onto a sub-site like I did with Atlas Rises and will also clear out all the old tags on the Main Repository so we can start fresh after the update.

Oct 29th 2018 Update:

The Abyss update is out and although ocean biomes got an overhaul it appears the universe didn't go through any wide-scale reset. Since procedural generation didn't reset I'm not going to split the database or archive the addresses submitted during NEXT.
