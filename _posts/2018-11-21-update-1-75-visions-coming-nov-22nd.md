Hello Games announced today the upcoming release of their next named update,Â  <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/visions-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Version 1.75: <em>Visions</em></strong></a>.

This new update includes a huge list of improvements and changes with a notable focus on new exotic biomes and more planetary variety. You can watch the trailer for the <em>Visions</em> update below:

Although the <em>Abyss</em> update didn't cause a universal reset it did change the content of the oceans, with new flora and fauna. I suspect <em>Visions</em> will do something similar, modify existing biomes but not cause a complete transformation. My plan is to start adding keyword tags for each address submitted to start identifying which update it was posted under (<em>NEXT</em>, <em>Abyss</em>, <em>Visions</em>, etc).
