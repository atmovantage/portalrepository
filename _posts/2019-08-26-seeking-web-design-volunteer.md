The Portal Repository has grown organically since 2017 and has undergone several minor design changes, but now I am seeking a volunteer to help with a complete web design overhaul.

Any potential candidate should be very familiar with WordPress and modern web design practices. Knowledge of PHP, Javascript, Jquery also would be required. Time commitment can be flexible to accommodate your schedule, but I would ask that you can devote at least several hours per week to this project.

Like this website itself, the Web Designer role would be a purely voluntary position for a <em>No Man's Sky</em> fan who wants to build a tool used to help thousands of fellow Travellers every day.

Interested in joining The Portal Repository as a Web Designer? Send an email to <a href="mailto:admin@portalrepository.com">admin@portalrepository.com</a> describing your background in web design and a little blurb about why you want to volunteer for The Portal Repository.
