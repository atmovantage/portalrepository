Today several articles came out with additional information from Sean Murray about the mysterious third pillar, now officially dubbed <em>No Man's Sky: 2.0</em>.

I've summarized some of the new features below and the links to the original articles are included at the bottom of this post.

<strong><em>No Man's Sky 2.0</em> Features Include:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>- Creature Riding</li>
 	<li>- Creature Farming</li>
 	<li>- Creature Milking 0_o</li>
 	<li>- Creature Taming</li>
 	<li>- NPC's walking around on planets</li>
 	<li>- Deeper missions</li>
 	<li>- New alien languages</li>
 	<li>- New alien races</li>
 	<li>- Larger base limits</li>
 	<li>- Industrial-type bases
<ul>
 	<li>-- Generators</li>
 	<li>-- Solar panels</li>
 	<li>-- Mining extractors</li>
</ul>
</li>
