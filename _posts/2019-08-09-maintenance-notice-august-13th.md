Please note that the last day to submit portal addresses for <em>NEXT</em> is August 13th 1200Z. After this time The Portal Repository will go into maintenance mode in order to archive all <em>NEXT</em> addresses and prepare for the <em>Beyond </em>update.

The maintenance window could take up to 24 hours. I will make a great effort to restore the site in time for the <em>Beyond</em> release on August 14th. Depending on the exact new features introduced by <em>Beyond</em> I can't rule out the possibility of brief maintenance down-times on the days following the release.

During the maintenance mode the portal submission form will be disabled but I will do my best to keep the rest of the site available so users can still browse the existing addresses. However, due to some intensive background processes happening during the maintenance mode the site may occasionally be slow or unresponsive.

Thanks in advance for your patience and understanding!
