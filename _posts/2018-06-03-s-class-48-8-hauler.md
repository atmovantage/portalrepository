<strong>Crashed ships don't show up when you walk through a portal. In order to acquire this ship you can do one of the following:</strong>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">1. Go through the portal and set a custom waypoint on the Galactic Map from the Discoveries menu. Then return to your original planet, go to space and follow the custom waypoint path to this planet (could be a long way depending on where you are in relation to this region of space).</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">2.Â <strong>If no other player bases are in this system</strong> you can go through the portal and claim a temporary base on this planet (suggest turning Base Sharing off while you do this). Upon returning to your newly-claimed temporary base, the crashed ship will show up.</span>
