So who's the "Man Behind the Curtain" of this website? My name's Austin (gamer tag "HusbandVader") and I'm an avid fan of No Man's Sky. I'm also a full-time meteorologist and I operate a <a href="https://austinsatmosphere.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small web design business</a>. My specialty is in developing sleek and professional websites at a low cost using the WordPress Content Management System.

I started designing websites for fun in 2011 when I was in college and eventually launched my own web design company in 2013 after business expanded.
