I'm very excited to announce that The Portal Repository has officially reached over 1000 addresses!

Here's a breakdown of some of the stats:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>1002 </strong>addresses as of Feb 11th, 2019
<ul>
 	<li><strong>490 </strong>addresses on PC</li>
 	<li><strong>412 </strong>addresses on PS4</li>
 	<li><strong>100 </strong>addresses on Xbox</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>October 17th, 2017</strong> was when the first address was published</li>
 	<li><strong>461,319</strong> page views since the site was launched (if you don't count browsers with Do Not Track active. In reality it's closer to 900,000 views)</li>
 	<li><strong>360</strong> addresses were posted during the Atlas Rises version (pre-NEXT)</li>
 	<li><strong>656</strong> players registered</li>
 	<li><strong>83%</strong> of post-NEXT addresses are in Normal game mode</li>
 	<li><strong>27 </strong>civilizations posted at least one address</li>
 	<li><strong>15 </strong>different galaxies</li>
 	<li><strong>16 </strong>people financially supported this website (see the footer for full list - <em>thanks!)</em></li>
</ul>
This site has growth substantially in just over a year since inception and it's all thanks to the dedicated players that have shared their portal addresses! The popularity of <em>No Man's Sky</em> waxes and wanes with each update, but the core of the community is solid. Even during the quietest times this site doesn't go more than a day without a new address being uploaded.

I'd like to congratulate two players in particular, <a href="https://twitter.com/Elmseeker">Elmseeker</a> and <a class="twitter-atreply pretty-link js-nav" dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/Vangelis2019" data-mentioned-user-id="2533650780">Vangelis2019</a> for posting the addresses that took us over 1000:

Thank you to everyone who's contributed to The Repository so far! Let's go for 2000!
