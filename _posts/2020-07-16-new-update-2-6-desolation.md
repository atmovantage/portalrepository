HelloGames have released a new <em>No Man's Sky</em> update called <strong>Desolation</strong>.

New features include salvageable (and dangerous!) derelict freighters, freighter customization, new light/bloom effects and new storyline lore.

"Each star system has one derelict freighter style, allowing Travellers to share the portal address of systems with particularly interesting wrecks."

I have added a new tag to the portal submission form for "Derelict Freighter" so players can share their interesting and system-specific wrecks with the community.
