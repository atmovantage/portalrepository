Good Morning No Man's Skyers!

I just wanted to do a quick update and let everyone know that a new field has been added to the portal address submission form: <strong>Friend Code</strong>.

All No Man's Sky players have a unique code (ex. XXXX-1234-ABC1D) that can be used to add other players to your friends group, making it easier to join each other's games.

If you would like to share your own friend code with the world feel free to do so when you submit your portal address. Your friend code will be displayed underneath your player name and will be visible to everyone.

Obviously filling in your unique friend code is optional and users should be aware that by sharing this information they may have strangers joining their games and/or requesting to be your friend in No Man's Sky. Although some people enjoy this experience, others do not. If you use someone's friend code to join their game please be polite and respectful at all times.
