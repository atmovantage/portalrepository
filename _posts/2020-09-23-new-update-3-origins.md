Today Sean Murray and Hello Games released the patch notes for the next update: Version 3.0 Origins: (<a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/origins-update/">Read Full Patch Notes Here</a>)

This new update brings a lot of exciting features that long-time players have always wanted.
<blockquote>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Update 3.0, <strong>Origins</strong>, dramatically expands the universe of No Manâ€™s Sky. Explore a <strong>stranger</strong>, <strong>richer</strong> and more <strong>varied</strong> universe, with deeper planetary diversity, dramatic new terrain, a host of new creatures, new weather conditions, colossal buildings, and much more.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Whilst flora, fauna and atmospheric conditions have changed throughout the universe, existing worlds will retain their old character, allowing player bases to remain undisturbed.</p>
