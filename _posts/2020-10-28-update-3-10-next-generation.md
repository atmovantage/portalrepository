Following hot on the heels of the Halloween update, Hello Games have announced another update called <strong>Next Generation!Â </strong>This update is scheduled to be released on November 10th to correspond with the launch of the next-gen Xbox and PlayStation consoles.

Next Generation brings compatibility for new console players on the next generation of PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Additionally, PC players with "Ultra" settings will also benefit from the improved visuals and graphical enhancements.

The full patch notes can be read <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/next-generation-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

Here on The Portal Repository I've made some changes to support this latest update:
<ul>
 	<li>- Added new platform categories for PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles
<ul>
 	<li>- This is now selectable in the submission form for new portal addresses</li>
 	<li>- Sub-categories for galaxies 1-10 have been created for PS5 and Xbox Series X</li>
 	<li>- New platforms and sub-categories are added to top menu</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>- Added new version tag for "Next Generation"</li>
</ul>
