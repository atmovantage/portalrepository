Hello Games has officially announced the release date of the next update, Beyond, as <strong>August 14th, 2019.</strong> Thus far we know two of the three major components to this update are No Man's Sky Online and VR support. The third "pillar" of Beyond remains unknown at this time but may be announced at some time in the next couple weeks before the release.

The announcement was accompanied by a slightly different 4-second clip that shows a little more of what appears to be the inside of a new structure. The structure is vaguely similar to a space station or Atlas Interface, with landing pads, consoles, holograms and walkways, etc. The actual purpose and context of this new structure is still a mystery.
