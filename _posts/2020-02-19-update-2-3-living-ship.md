Today Sean Murray and Hello Games announced a new update, version 2.3 Living Ships! This update introduces new organic-based ship types, new space exploration experiences and a variety of smaller quality-of-life improvements.

You can read the full patch notes <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/living-ship-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

Since this new update only introduces new content and does not seem to affect procedurally-generated planet/system characteristics there will be no need to archive previous version portal addresses from Beyond or Synthesis updates. New addresses published after today will be appended with the new "Game Version: Living Ships" tag.
