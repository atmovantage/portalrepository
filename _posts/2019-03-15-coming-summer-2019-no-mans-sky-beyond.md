Today Hello Games announced the next update to <em>No Man's Sky, </em>called <strong><em>Beyond</em>. </strong>This new update will feature 3 major components, the first of which is "<em>No Man's Sky Online".</em>
<blockquote>No Man’s Sky Online includes a radical new social and multiplayer experience which empowers players everywhere in the universe to meet and play together. Whilst this brings people together like never before, and has many recognisable online elements, we don’t consider No Man’s Sky to be an MMO – it won’t require a subscription, won’t contain microtransactions, and will be free for all existing players.</blockquote>

The other two components remain unknown at this time, but Sean Murray assures us that all will be revealed in due time. <em>Beyond</em> is expected to be released sometime in the summer of 2019. The Portal Repository will continue to post new information as it becomes available.
