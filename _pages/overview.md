<h1>Purpose</h1>
Before The Portal Repository was founded people would share their portal coordinates in forum threads, Reddit posts or Discord chats , however the main problem with all of these options was that they were difficult to search,  often were missing critical information such as galaxy, game mode and platform and would eventually get buried and lost over time.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The purpose of The Portal Repository is to provide Travellers of <em>No Man's Sky</em> with a high-quality, searchable database of known portal addresses in order to facilitate exploration, wealth creation and community interaction. </strong></span>
<h1>Principles:</h1>
<strong>1. Quality</strong>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">All addresses in The Portal Repository will contain at a minimum the planet name, biome, platform and game mode, with optional additional meta fields available to contain as much detail as possible.</p>
<strong>2. Organization</strong>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Addresses use a taxonomy combination of categories, tags and meta data to ensure easy readability, filtering and sorting.</p>
<strong>3. Accessibility</strong>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Users are able to query the database from any type of device using flexible search criteria in order to return only desired and relevant results. Furthermore, the process to submit addresses to the Repository is simple and user-friendly.</p>
<strong>4. Objectivity  </strong>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">All portal addresses that meet the minimum quality requirements are qualified to be published, regardless of any associations with other player groups, hubs, civilizations, alliances, etc. (Exception being the use of vulgar/explicit names) .</p>
